                Welcome to my website - built and maintained by me. I’m a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Southampton, having recently completed my first year of study. 
                My academic journey is driven by a passion for problem-solving and using software to build meaningful, practical solutions.
                <br><br>
                Before university, I took a gap year to reflect on my goals, work in retail, and pursue personal programming projects. This period helped me develop both soft skills and technical confidence, 
                laying the groundwork for my current academic growth.
                <br><br>
                You can find some of my personal projects, such as a password manager on the <a class="inlineLink" href="projects.html">My Projects</a> page or directly on <a class="inlineLink" href="https://github.com/ChristianGleitzman">GitHub</a>.

            <p class="section-text">
                My first-year modules have equipped me with a strong foundation in both theory and practice. I’ve gained experience in:
                <ul>
                    <li>Object-oriented programming, GUIs, multithreading, and lambdas (Java)</li>
                    <li>SQL and data management using relational databases</li>
                    <li>Computer systems, networks, and cybersecurity fundamentals</li>
                    <li>Data structures, algorithm design, and analysis</li>
                    <li>Mathematical reasoning, technical writing, and presentations</li>
                </ul>
                Outside of university, I continue to work in retail during academic breaks which has strengthened my teamwork, communication, and adaptability in high-pressure environments.

            <h3 class="section-title">Future Aspirations</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
                I’m eager to apply my growing technical skill set in real-world settings - whether through internships, collaborative projects, or freelance work. 
                My long-term goal is to contribute to impactful software that addresses real-world challenges and improves lives.
