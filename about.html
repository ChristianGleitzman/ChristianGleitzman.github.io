            <p class="section-text">Welcome to my website, developed and maintained by me. I am a first year undergraduate student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Southampton.
                I am proficient in Python and SQL but am always learning new things. I attained outstanding GCSE and A level grades
                that I am very proud of, achieving A*A*A*A in maths, further maths, computer science and an EPQ as well as 
                grade level 9 in all of the GCSE subjects I studied. During a gap year, I worked in retail while mapping my future at university and completing personal projects.
                Some of my past and current projects, such as my A-level maths revision game or movie ranking system, can be viewed on this website or on my GitHub profile.</p></p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Current Activities</h3>
            <p class="section-text">I have recently finished my first semester in my first year of undergraduate study at the University of Southampton. I completed modules in data managment, programming, 
                computer systems and mathematics. These modules gave me some strong initial foundations for me to further develop and build my skills as a computer scientist. I am avidly looking forward to
                my next semester's modules where I will be learning more advanced programming in Java, learning different data sturtures and algorithms as well as analysing them, understanding the cybersecurity
                landscape and much more!</p>
