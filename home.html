                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Welcome to my website, developed and maintained by me. I am a student currently in a gap year, with a passion for software engineering and data science.
                I am proficient in Python and SQL but am always learning new things. I attained outstanding GCSE and A level grades
                that I am very proud of, achieving A*A*A*A in maths, further maths, computer science and an EPQ as well as 
                grade level 9 in all of the GCSE subjects I studied.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-division">
                <h3>Current Activities</h3>
                <p>At the moment, I am currently working a part-time job, learning more about programming/data science and completing personal projects.
                Some of my past and current projects, such as my A-level maths revision game or movie ranking system, can be viewed below or on my GitHub profile.</p>

                <h3>Future Aspirations</h3>
                <p>I am excited to be using this year to gain hands-on experience and improve my skills in programming and data science with an 
                aim to get to grips with machine learning modules such as scikit-learn. In the coming year, I hope to go on to either study
                Mathematics/Computer Science at university or complete a degree apprenticeship.

            <h3>A Level Maths Revision Game</h3>
            <p>This project is my A-level computer science coursework, in which I developed an interactive Maths Integration and Differentiation revision game. 
            The application uses a combination of client and server-side Python programs, as well as a central server database to store user data and questions. 
            The client-side program utilizes the PyQt5 library to create a visually engaging and user-friendly interface for login, main menu, and question answering. 
            The game features an immersive pyramid-like structure, where users progress by correctly answering questions. I implemented this feature using the pygame library. 
            The server program handles various requests from connected clients with the help of the 'socket' Python library, such as login requests, fetching questions, 
            and saving user performance data to the server database.</p>
            <h4>Outcomes:</h4>
            <br>
            <p>This project provided me with valuable experience in working with stakeholders, designing and implementing a program and relational database from the ground up, 
            utilizing and understanding a variety of Python modules, applying theoretical concepts learned in computer science classes in a practical setting, making modifications to the program based on feedback, 
            thorough testing and debugging, and using problem-solving skills to find solutions.
            <br><br>
            The end result was a program that achieved its purpose of helping students at my school practice their Maths, with many finding it to be a useful tool in their revision process.</p>

            <h3>Movie Ranker</h3>
            <p>This program is a movie ranking system that uses the Elo rating system to rank movies based on user opinions during match-ups.</p>
            <h4>What the program does:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The program starts with a list of movies and their attributes (e.g. title, year, director, etc.) which have been scraped from a movie database website.<br> Each movie is saved to a database and initializes the Elo rating for each movie to 1500.</li>
                <li>The program then prompts the user to compare two movies and input their opinion on which movie is better using a user interface created using PyQt5.</li>
                <li>Based on the user's input, the program updates the Elo ratings of the two movies using the Elo rating system formula and saves these changes to the database.</li>
                <li>The user can continue to complete movie matchups or view their least or most favourite movies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Calculator</h3>
            <p>A simple calculator application built using PyQt5, a library for creating desktop applications with Python. Qt Designer, a GUI layout and forms designer, was used for creating the calculator's interface.</p>
            <h4>Features:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)</li>
                <li>Ability to chain multiple operations together (e.g. 3 + 5 x 6)</li>
                <li>Memory functions (memory clear and recall)</li>
                <li>Clear and backspace buttons</li>
                <li>Scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, log, square root)</li>
